can you write me a website, that can deploy to azure. The website shows elements in two queues: main queue and sub queue.  Main queue's size is 3, sub queue size is dynamic. There will be a timer, that every 10 minutes, all sub queue elements pop up and pushed into main queue. Main queue elements pop up and pushed into sub queue. There should be animation to show the whole process. There should be a button to start the timer and reset the timer after shift happened. Can you write me html, js and css code separately in different files.
